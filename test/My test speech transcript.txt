In this experiment, the system converts spoken English into text, translates it into Slovak and then synthesizes it back into speech. 
The process involves three stages, speech recognition, machine translation, and text to speech. 
Each model introduces a small delay, so we will measure the overall latency. 
The main objective is to achieve natural communication despite language barriers.
