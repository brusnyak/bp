Bachelor Thesis Project Description: Real-Time Speech Translation in Online Conferences
Project Title
Real-Time Speech Translation in Online Conferences
Overview
This bachelor thesis develops a prototype system for real-time speech translation during online conferences, overcoming language barriers for seamless multilingual communication. The solution integrates cutting-edge speech-to-text (STT), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies in a robust backend-focused implementation. Initial development and validation prioritize backend performance to achieve <10 seconds end-to-end latency. All components are free, open-source, and optimized for local execution on Mac M1 Pro using Apple Silicon MPS acceleration for efficient, dependency-aligned operation.
Key Features and Technical Approach
1. Voice Cloning for Natural, Personalized Synthesis

Zero-shot voice cloning enabled via short reference audio (e.g., 5 seconds from test/Voice-Training.wav).
Delivers personalized translated speech in the speaker's own voice, enhancing naturalness for conference settings.

2. Dual-Model Text-to-Speech (TTS) System
To optimize quality, speed, multilingual support, and Slovak presentation compatibility (via Czech proxy):

CZ)<200 msCustom training

Chatterbox: Production-grade, supports fine-tuning for Czech/Slovak (pre-trained CZ model available). Currently facing `get_speaker_embedding` API issues and `torch` version conflicts, temporarily disabled.
Piper: Instant switch for minimal latency; native Czech (cs) voices for accurate Slovak-like output. Requires manual download of model files.

3. Best-in-Class Speech-to-Text (STT)

Faster-Whisper: Currently facing MPS compatibility issues with `torch`. Switched to `mlx-whisper` as a faster and more compatible alternative for real-time streaming + VAD on Mac M1 Pro.

4. Efficient Machine Translation (MT)

NLLB-200-distilled: Quantized (int8/4-bit), MPS-accelerated for EN ↔ SK with minimal delay. Currently producing garbage output on MPS, indicating compatibility issues with `transformers` and `torch` on Apple Silicon. Re-evaluating strategy for MT.

5. Multilingual Support

Primary: English ↔ Slovak.
Slovak TTS: Czech (CZ) proxy via Piper native or Chatterbox fine-tuned (community CZ model exists; easy SK adaptation).
Extensible: Model-agnostic pipelines for 100+ languages.

System Architecture
Backend (Python/FastAPI/WebSockets): Core pipeline (STT → MT → TTS).
Frontend (ui/): Simple HTML/JS/CSS for testing (live subs, audio I/O).
Development and Testing Workflow (Backend-Focused)

Setup: pip install chatterbox-tts piper-tts faster-whisper transformers torch[mps]. (Note: `faster-whisper` MPS compatibility with `torch` is being re-evaluated; `mlx-whisper` may require different setup.)
Load Models: Quantized STT/MT/TTS with MPS.
Voice Prep: Extract embeddings from reference WAV.
Process: Stream input → Translate → Synthesize (dynamic model select).
Test: Latency/accuracy in simulated conferences.

Dependency Alignment: ✅ Perfect – Chatterbox (PyTorch/MPS), Piper (ONNX/C++), no conflicts. (Note: `mlx-whisper` dependencies will need to be integrated.)
Production Version Considerations

Blackhole 2ch input: Capture Zoom/Teams audio streams.
Output: Virtual speakers or direct injection.

User Interface (UI)

ui/index.html: Record/upload, live display.
ui/script.js: WebSocket backend comms.
ui/style.css: Responsive demo-ready.
