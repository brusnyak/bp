        <h1>Cookie Policy for Real-Time Speech Translation</h1>
        <p>
          This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, and
          your choices regarding their use.
        </p>

        <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or
          mobile device) when you browse a website. They are widely used to
          "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single visit
          (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a
          "persistent cookie").
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            **Essential Cookies:** These cookies are strictly necessary to
            provide you with services available through our website and to
            enable you to use some of its features, such as accessing secure
            areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Performance and Functionality Cookies:** These cookies are used to
            enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are
            non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain
            functionality (like remembering your preferences) may become
            unavailable.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Analytics and Customization Cookies:** These cookies collect
            information that is used either in aggregate form to help us
            understand how our website is being used or how effective our
            marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Theme Preference Cookie:** We use a cookie to remember your chosen
            theme preference (light or dark mode) so that your selection
            persists across sessions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choices Regarding Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
          can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate
          opt-out links provided in the cookie consent banner or by setting your
          preferences in your browser.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            **Browser Controls:** Most web browsers allow you to control cookies
            through their settings. You can usually find these settings in the
            "options" or "preferences" menu of your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Third-Party Opt-Outs:** For more information on how to control
