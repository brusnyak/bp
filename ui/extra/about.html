        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Lingonberry, a project dedicated to breaking down language
          barriers through innovative real-time speech translation technology.
          Our mission is to foster seamless communication and understanding in a
          globalized world, making virtual interactions more inclusive and
          productive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project originated as a Bachelor's thesis, focusing on the
          design, implementation, and evaluation of a robust real-time speech
          translation system. We leverage state-of-the-art open-source models
          for Speech-to-Text (STT), Machine Translation (MT), and Text-to-Speech
          (TTS) to deliver low-latency, high-quality translations.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a world where language is no longer a barrier to
          connection and collaboration. By providing accessible and efficient
          translation tools, we aim to empower individuals and organizations to
          communicate freely, regardless of their native tongue.
        </p>
